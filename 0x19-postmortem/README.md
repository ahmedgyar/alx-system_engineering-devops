Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage:

Start: June 10, 2024, 14:00 UTC
End: June 10, 2024, 16:30 UTC
Impact:

Our e-commerce platform was completely inaccessible to users, resulting in a 100% service outage.
Customers experienced a "503 Service Unavailable" error when trying to access the website.
Approximately 15,000 users were affected during this period.
Root Cause:

The root cause was an expired SSL certificate, which caused the web servers to fail in establishing secure connections.
Timeline
14:00 UTC: Issue detected by the monitoring system alerting a spike in 503 errors.
14:05 UTC: On-call engineer received an alert and began investigating the web server logs.
14:15 UTC: Initial assumption was a possible DDoS attack due to the high number of failed requests.
14:30 UTC: Network team was brought in to check for any unusual traffic patterns; no anomalies found.
14:45 UTC: Further investigation into the server configuration and certificate logs.
15:00 UTC: SSL certificate expiration noticed by the infrastructure team.
15:10 UTC: Issue escalated to the DevOps team to renew and deploy a new SSL certificate.
15:30 UTC: New SSL certificate procured and deployed to the web servers.
16:00 UTC: Web servers restarted, and services began to recover.
16:30 UTC: Full service restoration confirmed, monitoring returned to normal levels.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:

The SSL certificate for our primary domain expired. This caused all HTTPS requests to fail, as the web servers were configured to enforce HTTPS connections. Without a valid certificate, secure connections could not be established, resulting in a complete service outage.
Resolution:

The expired SSL certificate was identified as the culprit. The immediate resolution involved obtaining a new SSL certificate from our Certificate Authority (CA). Once the new certificate was procured, it was deployed across all our web servers. After deploying the new certificate, the web servers were restarted to apply the changes, which restored secure connections and brought the services back online.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Implement an automated system to monitor SSL certificate expiration dates and alert the team well in advance.
Automate the renewal and deployment process for SSL certificates to minimize the risk of human error and delay.
Enhance the monitoring system to differentiate between SSL-related issues and other types of outages, to streamline the troubleshooting process.
Tasks:

Patch Monitoring System:
Integrate SSL certificate monitoring into our existing monitoring framework.
Set up alerts for certificates expiring within 30, 15, and 7 days.
Automate Certificate Renewal:
Implement scripts to automatically renew SSL certificates using APIs provided by our CA.
Automate the deployment of new certificates to all web servers.
Update Documentation:
Revise the incident response playbook to include steps for checking SSL certificate validity.
Document the automated renewal and deployment process.
Conduct Training:
Train the engineering and DevOps teams on the new monitoring and automation tools.
Simulate SSL expiration scenarios to ensure the team can handle similar incidents swiftly in the future.
Review and Test Backup Plans:
Ensure that backup SSL certificates are available and can be quickly deployed in an emergency.
Regularly test the deployment process of backup certificates to ensure readiness.
By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent future SSL-related outages and improve our overall incident response efficiency.
